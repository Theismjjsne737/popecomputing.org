## About

Parts4Hearts is the refurbishing branch of the Pope
Computing Club. Parts4Hearts seeks to provide students in
need around the metropolitan Atlanta area with fully
functional laptops, closing the digital divide. The Club
also donates a portion of refurbished computers to the
[World Computer
Exchange](https://worldcomputerexchange.org), an
organization that ships computers to students in need
overseas.
