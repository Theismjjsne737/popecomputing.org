following are just a few examples:

  software, and security.

  friends in [Code
  Golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf).

  [Capture-The-Flag
  events](https://dev.to/atan/what-is-ctf-and-how-to-get-started-3f04).

  Exchange](https://worldcomputerexchange.org/), a volunteer
  organization that, among other things, donates computers
  loaded with educational content to schools in need across
  the world.
