## Mission Statement

Computing Club seeks to spread and facilitate a love of
computer science and public service among students of [Pope

## Activities

Computing Club offers a number of activites for members. The
following are just a few examples:

* Meet with likeminded peers to discuss computer hardware,
  software, and security.

* Hone your programming skills by competing with your
  friends in [Code
  Golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf).

* Learn about cybersecurity by participating in
  [Capture-The-Flag
  events](https://dev.to/atan/what-is-ctf-and-how-to-get-started-3f04).

* Refurbish computers for the [World Computer
  Exchange](https://worldcomputerexchange.org/), a volunteer
  organization that, among other things, donates computers
  loaded with educational content to schools in need across
  the world.
