# CompSci Conquerors

## About

CompSci Conquerors is the competition and fundraising branch
of the Computing Club.

## Linux Environment

A Linux environment is nearly required to effectively
compete in computer science competitions. We recommend
installing your pick of Linux distribution on bare-metal and
getting comfortable with it. Alternatively, you can create a
live-boot USB flash drive for a distribution made especially
for your task. For example, [Kali
Linux](https://www.kali.org/) is a popular choice for CTF's,
penetration testing, and other cybersecurity competitions.

## Get Your Feet Wet

If you have never touched Linux or a command line,
[OverTheWire:
Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) is a good
place to start learning basic functionality of your
environment. This 'wargame' walks through everything from
how to read the contents of a file to process scheduling.

## Further Practice

[VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) is a repository of
vulnerable, user-submitted virtual machines. You can run
them with virtualization software like VirtualBox and test
your skills on your own computer.
